**In less than 5 minutes**, you will use Supaglue to deploy a basic Salesforce integration that allows your customers to sync their Salesforce objects to a sample Next.js application.

## Clone and start Supaglue

```bash
# Clone our repo
git clone -b v0.2.0 git@github.com:supaglue-labs/supaglue.git && cd supaglue

# Create an encryption secret for credentials
echo "SUPAGLUE_API_ENCRYPTION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)" >> .env

# Start the Supaglue stack
docker compose up
```

## Install sample app

We've provided a [sample Next.js app](https://github.com/supaglue-labs/supaglue/blob/v0.2.0/apps/sample-app/). The sample app represents your own application where you would like your customers to connect their Salesforce instance.

In this step, we will set up the sample application.

1. Open a new terminal window and install the sample app (note: we've bundled it into our monorepo):

NOTE: for your convenience, [setup_env.sh](https://github.com/supaglue-labs/supaglue/blob/v0.2.0/apps/sample-app/scripts/setup_env.sh) helps you get started quickly by using our Salesforce Connected App credentials. You can also [set up](/references/salesforce-connected-app-asetup) or use your own Connected App credentials by changing the credentials in `.env`.

```bash
cd apps/sample-app
./scripts/setup_env.sh
yarn workspaces focus sample-app
npm install -g @supaglue/cli
```

2. Start the sample app locally:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The sample app can be accessed at (http://localhost:3000) and by logging in as a mock customer with username: `user1` and password: `password`. You should see the following empty table, indicating no Salesforce records have yet synced to the sample app.

## Deploy Supaglue config

In this step, we will deploy Supaglue configuration to enable customers (i.e. `user1` from the previous step) to sync Salesforce Contacts, Leads, and Opportunities

1. Open a new terminal window and deploy the sample Developer Config using the CLI:

```bash
cd apps/sample-app
supaglue apply supaglue-config/
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
...
╔══════════════════╤═════════╤════════╗
║ Name             │ Action  │ Status ║
╟──────────────────┼─────────┼────────╢
║ Contacts         │ Created │ Live   ║
╟──────────────────┼─────────┼────────╢
║ Leads            │ Created │ Live   ║
╟──────────────────┼─────────┼────────╢
║ Opportunities    │ Created │ Live   ║
╚══════════════════╧═════════╧════════╝

Syncs Created: 3, Updated: 0, Deleted: 0, No Change: 0
```

2. Navigate to the [Integrations](http://localhost:3000/integrations) page. You should now see a card that allows you to connect your Salesforce instance.

3. Click the "Connect" button and enter your Salesforce credentials to go through the OAuth flow. Note: these could be your Salesforce Developer or sandbox account login credentials.

Upon successful login, you will be redirected to the [Salesforce Integrations page](http://localhost:3000/integrations/salesforce).

## Run a Salesforce sync

1. Click the "Run sync now" button to trigger an inbound sync from your Salesforce into the sample app.

2. Navigate to the [App Objects](http://localhost:3000/) page and you will now see contacts from your Salesforce instance in a table! (You may have to refresh a few times if you navigated to this page before the sync has completed.)
